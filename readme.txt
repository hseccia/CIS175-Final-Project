Description:

The first CRUD/databse program I have ever made. Created for the final project in my Android programming college class. Created in Android Studio (v 3.1.4) and coded in Java. Uses SQLite for database functions.

Bug List:
- "Incorrect username or password" pop-up often appears even when login information is valid
- Connect 4 game plays, but is incomplete
